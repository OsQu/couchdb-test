\section{Introduction}

CouchDB\footnote{http://couchdb.apache.org/} is a distributed database that is
designed around web technologies. Its API relies completely on HTTP protocol and
documents are stored in JSON format. CouchDB also promises to be highly
available, partition tolerant and eventually consistent.

Distributed systems are often categorized to two categories based on their
attributes. The categorization is made using CAP
theorem~\cite{gilbert2002brewer}. CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a
web service to simultaneously guarantee \emph{consistency}, \emph{availability}
and \emph{partition tolerance}. These properties are highly desirable for a
distributed system.  Consistency in the CAP theorem means that there exists an
order of operations that is equivalent as if all the operations were completed
by a single instance. In practice this means that the results of operations the
distributed system completes need to be communicated to the every node of the
system. For CAP theorem to consider a distributed system available, it needs to
response to every request received by non-failing node. Partition tolerance
means that the system needs to tolerate partitions in the network i.e.\ the
network can drop arbitrary amount of packages and the system should still
remain functional.

Since perfect network is impossible to build, network partitions will occur.
Based on the CAP theorem, a distributed system can not be consistent and
available at the same time, so distributed systems need to choose whether they
keep their data consistent at all times and refuse to response to some of the
queries, or remain available during partition but give up on the data
consistency. Systems that choose to be consistent during network partition are
categorized as CP, and systems that choose to be available are categorized as
AP.\

CP systems can guarantee consistency by making sure that majority of non-failing
nodes in the cluster has received the operation before sending client a
successful response. In case of network partition the system is split in to two
ore more smaller networks. The partition with majority of nodes can still accept
operations and they are replayed to nodes in the minority partitions when the
partition heals. However nodes in the minority partition can not accept any
operations, because they could be overridden by majority when the network heals
and that would violate consistency. One example of a CP system is
Raft consensus algorithm~\cite{ongaro2014search}.\todo[inline]{Need to elaborate
RAFT?}

AP systems guarantee availability by always accepting operations to every
non-failing node. This causes the system to be inconsistent because some
previous operations might not have been reached the node processing a request so
it is operating on inconsistent view of the system. However in case of a network
partition, AP system will continue responding to requests even with minority
partition. When the partition heals, the system needs a way to solve conflicting
operations to the same document that happened on the different sides of the
partition\todo{Mention something about conflict resolution}. The simplest way is
to always choose the most recent operation called Last-Write-Wins (LWW). The
problem with LWW is that it will discard losing writes and that could
potentially cause the system to lose data. Another approach is to try to merge
conflicting operations. However it can be shown that there exists no universal
merge function\todo{citation needed}. Some AP systems allows a user to write
their own merge function which is applied when the system detects a conflict.
Based on the business requirements of the user, this might or might be not
feasible. It is also possible to use data types that eliminate the possibility
of conflicts.\todo[inline]{Mention eventual consistency?}

Letia et al.\ introduced Commutative Replicate Data Types
(CRDT)~\cite{letia2009crdts} which ensures that there are no conflicts between
different versions of the data. They show that if concurrent updates to some
datum commute and all the replicas execute all updates in casual order, then the
replicas converge. This means that the system doesn't have to remain consistent
at all times in order to reach consistency eventually. A simple example of a
CRDT is \emph{set} with only addition operation. Since addition operation
commute, it can be applied to all replicas in different order and still the
system would reach the same state. Problem with CRDTs are that they are not
universal. While currently known CRDTs can be quite complex, they do not offer a
solution for every problem thus their usage need to be considered case by case.
